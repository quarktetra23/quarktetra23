## Hi there 👋

Name's Abhishek, senior at The College of Wooster studying Mathematics and Computer Science. 

- ⚡️ As a personal project, currently working on a creating a better, less anoying cpp linter, based on 100+ formatting guides in Google's C++ styling guide (https://google.github.io/styleguidecppguide.html). My goal is to make this [public](https://github.com/quarktetra23/cpplintx) by October 2025.
  
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with any solid resources on computational neuroscience. 

- 📫 You can reach me at amanhas26@wooster.edu with any questions!
